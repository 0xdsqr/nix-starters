</div>

[nix-starters](https://github.com/0xdsqr/nix-starters) is a collection of random nix starter projects. These aim to provide you with enough to get started working with common frameworks such as Golang, JavaScript, or Python. Quick and easy reference points for those that are lazy. Mostly for my writing and learning at [https://dsqr.dev](https://dsqr.dev)
